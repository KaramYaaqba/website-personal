      description: `As a Senior Full Stack Developer, I played a critical role in modernizing Medcor's Nurse Call Center application, transitioning it from a paper-based process to a fully digital solution. I developed a multi-tier backend using C#, VB.NET, and the .NET framework, incorporating SOAP (via WCF) and SignalR for communication, and utilized ADO.NET with MS SQL for data management. I followed Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and leveraged an in-house code generator to streamline class and code generation. Additionally, I implemented a REST API for seamless client connectivity and used Active Directory for secure authentication. By deploying the solution through CI/CD pipelines on an in-house IIS server, the system enabled real-time call logging and processing, reduced waiting times for patients, and allowed smooth integration of interpreters into calls, greatly enhancing efficiency and patient satisfaction.`
